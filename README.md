# NuspecFileBundledInNuGetPackageDemo
A demonstration for a question at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29122217/how-to-build-nuget-package-containing-a-nuspec-template-file)

The problem I'm trying to demonstrate is NuGet ignoring content with file extension .nuspec, which is either a bug or by design.
